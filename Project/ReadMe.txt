Project Summary:

Based on Assignment 7. By using Binary Search Tree, adding more functions which helps the online movie service keep mind of their stocks. In this program, it has nine things which are Find a Movie, Rent a Movie, Print the Inventory, Delete a Movie, Count the Movies, Return a Movie, Showing the History and Quit. Every time the services change the conditions of the movie, such like rent or return a movie, it will be record in another file forever. Return a Movie helps services not only rent a movie but also can return a movie and make record of this. Other things are same as what we did in Assignment7.



How to Run:

First, it will show a menu that owns nine selections which are Find a Movie, Rent a Movie, Print the Inventory, Delete a Movie, Count the Movies, Return a Movie, Showing the History and Quit. 

It can adjust movie’s information in the file, and get results. For example, if you want to look the details of one movie, input “7” and input a movie’s name, such as “Se7en”. It will show all the information about this movie. If you want to look at the history of what movie you rent or return, input “8” and all the things you did will be print out.
